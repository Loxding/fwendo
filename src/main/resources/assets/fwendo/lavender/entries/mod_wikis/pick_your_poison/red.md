Red Poison Dart Frogs will apply the **Stimulation** effect for 20 seconds.

---

- {red}Stimulation{}
 - Stimulation gives a speed boost and removes the limit of only being able to sprint with 3 or more hunger points.

;;;;;

- Instead, losing hunger while having the Stimulation effect will result in taking damage. Players will take 1 heart of damage each time half a hunger point is lost.
