**Amarite cannot be found naturally, it has to be grown.**
1. to grow an %{item.amarite.amarite_shard}% you have to find an Amethyst Geode with %{block.minecraft.budding_amethyst}% under y level 0
> Try using an [Altimeter](Remember to add a link for the altimeter later so it connects with the wiki page when you make it) to check the Y level
2. After you find %{block.minecraft.budding_amethyst}%, place a %{block.minecraft.magma_block}% underneath

;;;;;

3. Now place a %{block.minecraft.raw_gold_block}% on each side of the %{block.minecraft.budding_amethyst}%
4. Make sure the area above the %{block.minecraft.budding_amethyst}% is %{block.minecraft.air}%
5. After a while the %{block.minecraft.budding_amethyst}% should transform into a %{block.amarite.budding_amarite}% and start growing Amarite Crystals
> There is an interactive schematic on the next page.
