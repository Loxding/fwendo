Poison Dart Frogs can be found spawning in 7 different types in the various jungle variants. They can be picked up by using a bowl on them and will give the player their respective effect when hit or licked.

;;;;;

Licking a Poison Dart Frog can be done by “eating” the picked up version and will not consume the frog. You can not lick a Poison Dart Frog while you have its effect and the frogs themselves are immune to their effects.

;;;;;

Putting a picked up Poison Dart Frog back down requires holding <keybind;key.sneak> and using <keybind;key.use> at the same time.
