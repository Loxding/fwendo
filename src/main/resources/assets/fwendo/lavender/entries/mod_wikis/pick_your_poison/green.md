Green Poison Dart Frogs apply the **Numbness** effect for 20 seconds.

---

- {green}Numbness{}
 - Numbness prevents the player from taking any damage while the effect lasts. 

;;;;;

 - Instead, the damage is applied all at once as soon as the effect runs out. This cannot be bypassed using milk or commands.
